👋 Hi there, I'm a medical student and web3 developer.

👀 I'm interested in fintech, distributed systems, and blockchain technology.

🌱 Currently, I'm focused on developing my skills in deep learning systems for AI integrations in healthcare.

🧬 My goal is to create affordable healthcare solutions that can benefit people around the world.

🌊 In my free time, you can find me rock climbing or at the beach surfing.

🎓 I'm currently studying at Poznan University of Medical Sciences.
